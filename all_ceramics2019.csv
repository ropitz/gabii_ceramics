7434,5598,Terra Sigillata,"Edited by Amy Welch 2017. Two figural sherds:
The first is a fragment (7.1 g, 5 cm) of a wall depicting the torso of a nude male figure, possibly Hercules, with pronounced musculature. Figure has an unidentified object over his right shoulder, possibly a club. There is a cloth over his left shoulder with a lion or leopard face in the cloth.
The second is a fragment (30.4 g, 7cm) of a wall sherd depicting a figure in an arcade. Possible second figure or ship in second arcade? Quality of mold was very poor, very little detail visible on figures. Figure on the right is in profile, facing left with an unidentifiable object in his/her hand.
